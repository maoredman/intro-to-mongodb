# intro-to-mongodb

This repo contains my code for the [Introduction to MongoDB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb) online course offered by MongoDB Inc.

I'm using a free tier Atlas cluster as suggested by the course, which provides 512MB of free storage. Incidentally, this is the same quota as  provided by [mLab](https://mlab.com), which I used to help build a [web app that sends pretty HTML email](https://floating-journey-14614.herokuapp.com/#/signup) back in 2016. mLab has since been acquired by MongoDB.

Things I learnt include:
* MongoDB's Aggregation Pipeline (stages, operators, projections)
* MongoDB's query language for processing data (bulk updates, operators, collection methods, projection)
